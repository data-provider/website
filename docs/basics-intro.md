In this guide we'll walk through the process of creating a simple Todo app connected to a REST Api.

For illustrating the purpose of the library, we have chosen the [@data-provider/axios addon][data-provider-axios] as data origin, as the example can be closest to a real project. At the other hand, you will need a local server to run the example, but this can be achieved easily with [json-server][json-server], we will show you how in the last chapter of the guide.

The complete source code of the guide is in our repository of examples, but we recommend to follow next steps to better understand the concepts from the basics to more advanced ones:

* [Providers](basics-providers.md)
* [Selectors](basics-selectors.md)
* [Queries](basics-queries.md)
* [Relations](basics-relations.md)
* [Configuration](basics-configuration.md)
* [Usage with React](basics-usage-with-react.md)
* [Example](basics-example.md)
