Welcome to the Data Provider documentation!

## Navigation

You can find different topics in the table of contents. On desktop, you should see it in the left sidebar. On mobile, you should see it after pressing an icon with arrows in the top left corner.

## Acknowledges

The structure and style of this documentation is highly inspired by the [Redux documentation website][redux], which, in our opinion, is a great example of good documentation.

## Apologies

The main author of this docs is not a native english language speaker (he is far from being it), so we apologize for any misspelling or bad syntax. If you detect any of these errors, please [let us know][issues-url] or [contribute fixing it][repo-docs-url]. Thanks in advance.

## Something Missing?

If you have ideas for more “How To” recipes that should be on this page, [let us know][issues-url] or [contribute some][repo-docs-url]!

## Feedback
We are always open to [your feedback][issues-url].
